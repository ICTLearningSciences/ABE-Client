          "The hook of the essay has a weak engagement factor. It lacks both emotional evocativeness and narrative elements. The thesis statement is a simple greeting without any depth or compelling elements. To improve the hook, consider introducing a thought-provoking question, a surprising fact, or a captivating anecdote to capture the reader's attention. (Emotion: 1; Narrativity: 1)",
